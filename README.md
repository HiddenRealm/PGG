# PGG
This is my OpenGL game, it is the follow up to the drawing with pixels.

W = forward
S = Backword
A = Rotate Left
D = Rotate Right

Space = Fire

V = Change Camera View (First & Third Person)

Win the game by collecting the Fruit and the Rocks (was meant to shoot & kill the rocks, But, Boohoo)
Just drive into them

The games has basic collision, particles and camera controls
